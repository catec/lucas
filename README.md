# LUCAS: Lightweight framework for UAV Control And Supervision

Framework for UAV autonomous flight compatible with ArduPilot. The two modules that composed it are:

- **CATEC Control Manager:** Finite-state-machine for mission and behavior control.
- **Cascade PID Controller:** Module for trajectory control that interfaces with CATEC Control Manager and sent attitude set-points to autopilot via MAVROS.

Please check the README of each package for usage guidelines and more detailed information.
